An addon for the game Freelancer (2003) that replaces all existing character textures with HD ones.

This includes:
* Bodies
* Helmets
* Hands
* Heads
* Props

All original textures have been upscaled by 400% using  Real-ESRGAN (https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN), so 256x256 becomes 1024x1024, etc. The upscaling technology has allowed the quality of the textures to be improved without affecting their original look. Additionally, most of the upscaled results have been retouched and improved manually.

All files from this addon may be freely used by any mod or anything else. See the LICENSE file at https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-character-models/blob/main/LICENSE for more information.
