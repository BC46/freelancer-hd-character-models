<description>
An addon for the game Freelancer (2003) that replaces all existing character textures with HD ones.

This includes:
- Bodies
- Hands
- Heads
- Props

All original textures have been upscaled by 400% using ESRGAN, so 256x256 becomes 1024x1024, etc. The upscaling technology has allowed the quality of the textures to be improved without affecting their original look.

N.B. You may not notice the difference during general gameplay unless you're playing in a high resolution or viewing the characters up close
