# Freelancer HD Character Models
An addon for the game Freelancer (2003) that replaces all existing character textures with HD ones.

This includes:
* Bodies
* Hands
* Heads
* Props

All original textures have been upscaled by 400% using [ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN), so 256x256 becomes 1024x1024, etc. The upscaling technology has allowed the quality of the textures to be improved without affecting their original look.


**N.B. You may not notice the difference during general gameplay unless you're playing in a high resolution or viewing the characters up close**

All files from this addon may be freely used by any mod or anything else. See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-character-models/blob/main/LICENSE) file for more information.
