# Freelancer HD Character Models
An addon for the game Freelancer (2003) that replaces all existing character textures with HD ones.

This includes:
* Bodies
* Hands
* Heads
* Props

All original textures have been upscaled by 400% using [ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN), so 256x256 becomes 1024x1024, etc. The upscaling technology has allowed the quality of the textures to be improved without affecting their original look.
